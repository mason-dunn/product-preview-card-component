## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I definitely want to come back to this project at some point and pool together a lot of the styles. I noticed a lot of repetition in my styles and I tried to condense it down the best I know for the time being.

The class names could maybe use some work, they don't follow any sort of convention other than chaining together the elements parent. This makes it sometimes a pain to read if it gets long.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow]([https://www.example.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32765039/using-margin-on-flex-items)) - I encountered an issue trying to use margin/padding on the product information that manipulated the product image. This StackOverflow thread taught me a work around using a nested div.
- [StackOverflow]([https://www.example.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27853884/media-queries-and-image-swapping)) - I've never dealt with changing entire images based on screen sizes. I found this thread that explained to me how to manage that.
